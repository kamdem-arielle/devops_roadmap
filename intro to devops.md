# Introduction to DevOps

Welcome to this simple introduction to **DevOps**! ðŸš€ 
Here we'll cover the basics of DevOps, SDLC, the DevOps lifecycle, Dev and Ops teams, Site Reliability Engineering all connected together.

# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) practices, aimed at automating and integrating the processes between software development and IT operations teams.
The goal is to shorten the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

The goal of DevOps is to:
- **Deliver software faster**
- **Improve the quality** of applications
- **Automate manual processes**
- **Ensure systems run reliably**

Traditionally, the Dev team worked in an Agile way â€” fast, iterative, flexible â€” while the Ops team worked in a Cascade (Waterfall) model â€” sequential, planned, and slower.
DevOps helps to bridge the gap between these two worlds by bringing them together in a more collaborative way, often inspired by ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) best practices for service management.

**DevOps** is a culture, a set of practices, and tools that bring together **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** teams to work **collaboratively** throughout the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.


DevOps emphasizes **communication**, **collaboration**, **continuous integration**, **continuous delivery (CI/CD)**, and **automation**.


# What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?

SDLC refers to the structured process used by development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications.
It ensures high quality and cost-effective software delivery through different phases:

1. **Requirement gathering**
2. **Design**
3. **Implementation (coding)**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**


**How it connects to DevOps:**
> DevOps improves SDLC by making every step **automated**, **faster**, and **collaborative**. Instead of throwing code over a wall to Ops, both teams work together through every phase.


# What is the DevOps Lifecycle?

The **DevOps lifecycle** shows the continuous loop of developing and delivering software.

The stages are:
- **Plan**: Define what needs to be built
- **Develop**: Write the code
- **Build**: Compile the code
- **Test**: Automatically test the application
- **Release**: Prepare the software for deployment
- **Deploy**: Deploy into production
- **Operate**: Run the software reliably
- **Monitor**: Check performance and fix issues

**How it connects:**
> In DevOps, everything is **continuous** (Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Monitoring) â€” no waiting for months to release software.


# Dev Team and Ops Team

- **Dev Team (Development)**: Write the code, create features, fix bugs.
- **Ops Team (Operations)**: Deploy code, maintain servers, ensure system uptime, monitor apps.

**How they connect in DevOps:**
> DevOps **breaks down the wall** between Dev and Ops. Developers write code **that can be deployed easily**, and Ops **provide feedback** to make the app more reliable.

# Summary

| Term | How It Connects to DevOps |
|-----|---------------------------|
| DevOps | The overall culture and process to deliver software faster and reliably |
| SDLC | DevOps optimizes every phase of SDLC |
| DevOps Lifecycle | Shows how DevOps is a continuous loop of improvement |
| Dev Team & Ops Team | In DevOps, they collaborate closely instead of working separately |
| Site Reliability Engineering | Makes systems reliable using DevOps principles |
| Zabbix | A monitoring tool essential for system reliability in DevOps |

# Final Note

DevOps is not just a set of tools â€” it's a **culture change**.  
It requires teams to **trust each other**, **automate everything possible**, and **continuously learn and improve**.
